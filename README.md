# schaap-py

Schaap is a simple signal-based probing profiler, capable of forwarding traces
to another machine or an aggregaing daemon. The traces are supposed to be
finally collected, dynamically aggregated and displayed nicely in a web UI,
thus providing another layer of performance monitoring.

### Name

"Schaap" is Dutch for a sheep. "py", stands for Python, the programming
language.
